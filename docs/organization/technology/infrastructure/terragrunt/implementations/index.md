# Terragrunt Implementations

This section provides detailed documentation of specific infrastructure implementations using Terragrunt. These implementations demonstrate how we use Terragrunt to manage complex AWS resources with reusable code patterns.

## Contents

- **[S3 & CloudFront Implementation](s3-cloudfront-implementation)**: Detailed technical documentation of our static assets infrastructure using S3 for storage and CloudFront for global content delivery.

## Implementation Principles

All our Terragrunt implementations follow these key principles:

- **Modularity**: Each component is self-contained and reusable
- **Clear Dependencies**: Dependencies between resources are explicitly defined
- **Consistent Structure**: Standard directory and file organization across all implementations
- **Centralized Variables**: Environment-specific variables are managed in central configuration files
- **Documentation**: All implementations include detailed documentation on usage and configuration

## Future Implementations

We plan to add documentation for these additional implementations:

- VPC and Network Implementation
- EKS Cluster Implementation
- Identity and Access Management
- Database Infrastructure
