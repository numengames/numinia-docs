# Kubernetes Security

This section documents the security aspects of our Kubernetes infrastructure, focusing on how we secure our applications and data while maintaining high availability and ease of management.

## Contents

- **[SSL Certificates](ssl-certificates)**: How we manage SSL/TLS certificates for our applications, providing secure HTTPS connections for all our services.

## Security Framework

Our Kubernetes security is built on several key components:

- **Network Policies**: Fine-grained control over pod-to-pod communication
- **RBAC**: Role-based access control for all cluster operations
- **Secret Management**: Secure handling of sensitive information using AWS Secrets Manager
- **Certificate Management**: Automated SSL/TLS certificate management
- **Pod Security Policies**: Enforcement of security best practices at the pod level

## Upcoming Documentation

We plan to expand this section with additional security documentation:

- Network Security Policies
- RBAC Configuration
- Secrets Management
- Security Monitoring and Auditing
- Vulnerability Management
