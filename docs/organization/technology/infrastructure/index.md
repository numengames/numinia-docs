# Infrastructure

This section documents our infrastructure architecture, implementation, and management practices. We've built a robust, scalable infrastructure that supports our applications and services across multiple environments.

## Contents

- **AWS Infrastructure**
  - **[AWS Architecture Overview](aws/aws-architecture-overview)**: Our core AWS infrastructure architecture.
  - **[Storage Solutions](aws/storage/)**: S3, CloudFront, and other storage implementations.

- **Infrastructure as Code**
  - **[Terragrunt Overview](terragrunt/terragrunt-overview)**: Our approach to infrastructure as code using Terragrunt.
  - **[Terragrunt Implementations](terragrunt/implementations/)**: Specific infrastructure implementations.

- **Kubernetes Platform**
  - **[Kubernetes Overview](kubernetes/kubernetes-overview)**: Architecture of our Kubernetes platform.
  - **[Security](kubernetes/security/)**: Security implementations, including SSL certificates.
  - **[Deployments](kubernetes/deployments/)**: Guides for deploying applications and organizations.

## Infrastructure Philosophy

Our infrastructure is designed around several core principles:

- **Infrastructure as Code**: All infrastructure is managed through code, enabling version control, testing, and automation.
- **GitOps**: Git repositories serve as the source of truth for infrastructure and application deployments.
- **Scalability**: Systems are designed to scale horizontally to handle varying workloads.
- **Reliability**: Multi-AZ deployments and redundant components ensure high availability.
- **Security**: Defense-in-depth approach with multiple security layers.
- **Cost Optimization**: Resources are sized appropriately and monitored for cost effectiveness.

## Environment Strategy

We maintain multiple environments to support the development lifecycle:

- **Development**: For active development and early testing
- **Staging**: For pre-production validation
- **Production**: For live customer-facing systems

Each environment follows the same infrastructure patterns with appropriate scaling and security considerations.

## Getting Started

New team members should start by understanding:

1. [AWS Architecture Overview](aws/aws-architecture-overview)
2. [Terragrunt Overview](terragrunt/terragrunt-overview)
3. [Kubernetes Overview](kubernetes/kubernetes-overview)

Before making changes to production infrastructure, consult with the infrastructure team and follow our change management processes.
