# Hyperfy Platform

This section details our implementation and customization of the Hyperfy platform, which serves as our primary 3D environment for creating immersive experiences. Hyperfy provides a flexible, WebGL-based foundation that we've extended to meet our specific requirements.

## Contents

- **[Hyperfy Integration](hyperfy-integration)**: Detailed documentation of our Hyperfy implementation, including platform fork, component development, and deployment strategy.
- **[Components](components)**: Documentation for our custom Hyperfy components, including usage guides, properties, and examples.

## Why Hyperfy

We selected Hyperfy as our primary 3D platform for several key reasons:

- **Self-hosting**: Complete control over infrastructure and deployment
- **Component Development**: Ability to create custom functionality
- **Platform Customization**: Flexibility to modify the core platform through our fork
- **Web-based Architecture**: Accessible across devices without installing applications
- **Performance**: Optimized for a wide range of hardware capabilities

## Implementation Areas

Our Hyperfy implementation focuses on three main areas:

1. **Platform Maintenance**: Our fork of the Hyperfy codebase, with customizations and optimizations
2. **Component Development**: Custom components extending the platform's functionality
3. **Deployment Infrastructure**: Containerized deployment within our Kubernetes environment

## Future Documentation

We plan to expand this section with additional documentation:

- Custom Component Development Guide
- Performance Optimization Strategies
- Asset Pipeline and Management
- Integration with Backend Services
