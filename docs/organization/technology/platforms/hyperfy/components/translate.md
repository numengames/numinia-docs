# Translate Component

The Translate component provides smooth 3D object translation animations with configurable speed, delays, and event-driven control for creating dynamic movement effects in your Hyperfy world. Think of it as a precision movement controller that can smoothly animate objects along any axis with customizable timing and synchronization.

**Important**: This component handles smooth translation animations frame-by-frame, not instant position changes. It can move objects to specific target positions with full control over speed, delays, and multi-axis movement.

## What Does It Do?

The Translate component is like having a precision movement controller for your 3D objects. You can:
- **Move objects smoothly** along X, Y, and Z axes with configurable speed
- **Create elevator systems** for vertical movement
- **Build sliding doors** and moving platforms
- **Control animation timing** with delays and speed settings
- **Sync movements** across all players in multiplayer environments
- **Chain actions** by triggering other components when movements complete
- **Pause and resume** animations for interactive control

**Important**: This component creates smooth, frame-by-frame translation animations. It moves objects from their current position to target positions with configurable speed. The animations are synchronized with physics collision when enabled.

## How Events Work

The Translate component listens for "signals" (events) from other components. When it receives a signal, it can start, pause, resume, or reset translation animations. The component uses its unique App ID (generated by Hyperfy) to identify itself in the event system.

### Event Format

In the `Event Listeners` field, you can specify events like this:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "a1b2c3d4e",
    "actions": [
      {
        "type": "set-translation",
        "params": {
          "translationY": 5,
          "translationSpeed": 0.2,
          "delay": 1.5
        }
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

**Note**: When referencing this component in events from other components, use the App ID that Hyperfy generated for this component. Also, when duplicating components, be sure you make the app unique, so it has a new AppID.

### Action Types

| Action | Description | Parameters |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| `set-translation` | Start movement to target position | `translationX`, `translationY`, `translationZ`, `translationSpeed`, `delay` |
| `pause-translation` | Pause current movement animation | None |
| `resume-translation` | Resume paused movement animation | None |
| `reset-translation` | Reset to initial position | `resetSpeed` (optional) |

### Event Parameters

When an event triggers a movement change, you can control:

| Parameter      | Type    | Description                                       |
| -------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `translationX` | number  | Target X position in units |
| `translationY` | number  | Target Y position in units |
| `translationZ` | number  | Target Z position in units |
| `translationSpeed`| number | Animation speed (units/frame) |
| `delay`        | number  | Seconds to wait before starting movement |

## Common Use Cases

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. **Add the Component**
- Drag the Translate component into your scene
- Select the 3D object you want to move

### 2. **Configure Basic Settings**
- Set the `Node Name` to match your 3D object's name
- Choose if the object should `Start Visible`
- Decide if it should `Add Collision` (be solid)

### 3. **Set Up Movement Parameters**
- Configure `Translation Speed` (start with 0.1 for smooth movement)
- Set target `X Translation`, `Y Translation`, `Z Translation` positions
- Enable `Sync Changes` if all players should see movements

### 4. **Configure Events**
- In `Event Listeners`, add the events that should trigger movements
- Use the JSON format shown above
- Replace event names with actual events from other components

### 5. **Test Your Setup**
- Enable `Debug Logs` to see what's happening
- Trigger your events and watch the object move
- Check that all players see the same movements

## Tips for Designers

### **Choosing Movement Speeds**
- Start with slow speeds (0.05-0.1) for smooth animations
- Use faster speeds (0.2-0.5) for quick movements
- Test different speeds to find the right feel for your object

### **Planning Movement Sequences**
- Consider the object's initial position when setting targets
- Use delays to create dramatic timing effects
- Plan for both single-player and multiplayer scenarios

### **Testing Your Setup**
- Always test with multiple players
- Use debug logs to troubleshoot issues
- Test edge cases (what happens if players disconnect?)

### **Performance Considerations**
- Translation animations run every frame - avoid too many simultaneous animations
- Higher translation speeds require more CPU per frame
- Consider the impact on mobile devices

## Troubleshooting

### **Movement Not Starting**
- Check that `Enable Translation` is set to `true`
- Verify that the event `id` matches exactly
- Ensure the Event Listeners JSON is valid
- Enable `Debug Logs` to see what's happening

### **Movement Too Fast/Slow**
- Adjust `Translation Speed` (lower = slower, higher = faster)
- Use `translationSpeed` parameter in events for runtime control
- Typical range: 0.05 (very slow) to 0.5 (fast)

### **Object Not Moving Smoothly**
- Check that `Translation Speed` is not too high
- Verify the target position is different from current position
- Enable Debug Mode to see movement progress

### **Collision Issues**
- Enable `Add Collision` if the object needs physics
- Check that both mesh and rigidbody are moving together
- Verify collision setup in Debug Mode logs

### **Delay Not Working**
- Ensure `Use Delay` is enabled
- Check that `Delay (sec)` is greater than 0
- Verify the delay value in your event parameters

## Best Practices

- **Start Simple**: Test with basic movements before adding complexity
- **Use Appropriate Speeds**: Choose movement speeds that feel natural
- **Plan for Multiplayer**: Consider how movements affect all players
- **Add Delays**: Use delays for smoother, more professional sequences
- **Test Thoroughly**: Always test with multiple players and scenarios
- **Use Debug Logs**: Enable debug mode during development
- **Document Your Setup**: Keep notes on your movement configurations
- **Consider Performance**: Limit simultaneous animations for optimal performance
- **Provide Control**: Always provide ways to stop or reset movements
- **Test Collision**: Verify collision works correctly with moving objects
