# Rotate Component

The Rotate component provides smooth 3D object rotation animations with configurable speed, delays, and event-driven control for creating dynamic rotation effects in your Hyperfy world. Think of it as a precision rotation controller that can smoothly animate objects around any axis with customizable timing and synchronization.

**Important**: This component handles smooth rotation animations frame-by-frame, not instant rotation changes. It can rotate objects continuously or to specific target angles, with full control over speed, delays, and multi-axis rotation.

## What Does It Do?

The Rotate component is like having a precision rotation controller for your 3D objects. You can:
- **Rotate objects smoothly** around X, Y, and Z axes with configurable speed
- **Create continuous rotation** for spinning objects like fans or wheels
- **Set target rotations** for precise angular positioning
- **Control animation timing** with delays and speed settings
- **Sync rotations** across all players in multiplayer environments
- **Chain actions** by triggering other components when rotations complete
- **Pause and resume** animations for interactive control

**Important**: This component creates smooth, frame-by-frame rotation animations. It can handle both target-based rotations (rotate to specific angles) and continuous rotations (spin indefinitely). The animations are synchronized with physics collision when enabled.

## How Events Work

The Rotate component listens for "signals" (events) from other components. When it receives a signal, it can start, pause, resume, or reset rotation animations. The component uses its unique App ID (generated by Hyperfy) to identify itself in the event system.

### Event Format

In the `Event Listeners` field, you can specify events like this:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "a1b2c3d4e",
    "actions": [
      {
        "type": "set-rotation",
        "params": {
          "rotationY": 90,
          "rotationSpeed": 0.02,
          "delay": 1.5
        }
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

**Note**: When referencing this component in events from other components, use the App ID that Hyperfy generated for this component. Also, when duplicating components, be sure you make the app unique, so it has a new AppID.

### Action Types

| Action | Description | Parameters |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| `set-rotation` | Start rotation to target angles | `rotationX`, `rotationY`, `rotationZ`, `rotationSpeed`, `delay` |
| `pause-rotation` | Pause current rotation animation | None |
| `resume-rotation` | Resume paused rotation animation | None |
| `reset-rotation` | Reset to initial rotation | `resetSpeed` (optional) |
| `continuous-rotation` | Start continuous rotation | `continuousSpeedX`, `continuousSpeedY`, `continuousSpeedZ`, `delay` |
| `stop-continuous-rotation` | Stop continuous rotation | None |

### Event Parameters

When an event triggers a rotation change, you can control:

| Parameter      | Type    | Description                                       |
| -------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------- |

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. **Add the Component**
- Drag the Rotate component into your scene
- Select the 3D object you want to rotate

### 2. **Configure Basic Settings**
- Set the `Node Name` to match your 3D object's name
- Choose if the object should `Start Visible`
- Decide if it should `Add Collision` (be solid)

### 3. **Set Up Rotation Parameters**
- Configure `Rotation Speed` (start with 0.01 for smooth rotation)
- Set target `X Rotation`, `Y Rotation`, `Z Rotation` angles
- Enable `Sync Changes` if all players should see rotations

### 4. **Configure Events**
- In `Event Listeners`, add the events that should trigger rotations
- Use the JSON format shown above
- Replace event names with actual events from other components

### 5. **Test Your Setup**
- Enable `Debug Logs` to see what's happening
- Trigger your events and watch the object rotate
- Check that all players see the same rotations

## Tips for Designers

### **Choosing Rotation Speeds**
- Start with slow speeds (0.005-0.01) for smooth animations
- Use faster speeds (0.02-0.05) for quick rotations
- Test different speeds to find the right feel for your object

### **Planning Rotation Sequences**
- Consider the object's initial rotation when setting targets
- Use delays to create dramatic timing effects
- Plan for both single-player and multiplayer scenarios

### **Testing Your Setup**
- Always test with multiple players
- Use debug logs to troubleshoot issues
- Test edge cases (what happens if players disconnect?)

### **Performance Considerations**
- Continuous rotation runs every frame - use sparingly
- Higher rotation speeds require more CPU per frame
- Consider the impact on mobile devices

## Troubleshooting

### **Rotation Not Starting**
- Check that `Enable Rotation` is set to `true`
- Verify that the event `id` matches exactly
- Ensure the Event Listeners JSON is valid
- Enable `Debug Logs` to see what's happening

### **Rotation Too Fast/Slow**
- Adjust `Rotation Speed` (lower = slower, higher = faster)
- Use `rotationSpeed` parameter in events for runtime control
- Typical range: 0.005 (very slow) to 0.05 (fast)

### **Object Not Rotating Smoothly**
- Check that `Rotation Speed` is not too high
- Verify the target rotation is different from current rotation
- Enable Debug Mode to see rotation progress

### **Continuous Rotation Issues**
- Use `continuous-rotation` action for indefinite spinning
- Provide a way to stop continuous rotation when needed
- Remember: continuous rotation runs every frame

### **Collision Issues**
- Enable `Add Collision` if the object needs physics
- Check that both mesh and rigidbody are rotating together
- Verify collision setup in Debug Mode logs

## Best Practices

- **Start Simple**: Test with basic rotations before adding complexity
- **Use Appropriate Speeds**: Choose rotation speeds that feel natural
- **Plan for Multiplayer**: Consider how rotations affect all players
- **Add Delays**: Use delays for smoother, more professional sequences
- **Test Thoroughly**: Always test with multiple players and scenarios
- **Use Debug Logs**: Enable debug mode during development
- **Document Your Setup**: Keep notes on your rotation configurations
- **Consider Performance**: Limit continuous rotations for optimal performance
- **Provide Control**: Always provide ways to stop or reset rotations
- **Test Collision**: Verify collision works correctly with rotated objects
