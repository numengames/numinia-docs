# Insert Password Component

The Insert Password component allows you to create secure password-protected interactions in your Hyperfy scene. Think of it as a digital lock that can control access to content, trigger events, or unlock hidden features when players enter the correct password. It works across all connected players, so password validation and UI state are synchronized for everyone.

**Important**: This component creates a password input UI that appears when triggered and validates user input against a master password. It can emit events on success/failure and control other components through the event system.

## What Does It Do?

The Insert Password component is like having a digital security system for your 3D world. You can:
- **Create password-protected areas** that require specific codes to access
- **Show/hide password UI** when players interact with triggers or buttons
- **Validate passwords** against a master password you set
- **Emit events** when passwords are correct or incorrect
- **Sync UI state** so all players see the same password interface
- **Chain actions** by triggering other components when passwords are validated
- **Add delays** for timed password reveals or effects

**Important**: This component creates a floating password input interface that appears when activated. Players type passwords using their keyboard, and the component validates them against your master password. For the best experience, combine this with other components that trigger the password UI.

## How Events Work

The Insert Password component listens for "signals" (events) from other components. When it receives a signal, it can show/hide the password UI or perform other actions. The component uses its unique App ID (generated by Hyperfy) to identify itself in the event system.

### Event Format

In the `Event Listeners` field, you can specify events like this:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "a1b2c3d4e",
    "actions": [
      {
        "type": "set-visibility",
        "params": {
          "isActive": true,
          "isSync": true,
          "delay": 1.5
        }
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

**Note**: When referencing this component in events from other components, use the App ID that Hyperfy generated for this component. Also, when duplicating components, be sure you make the app unique, so it has a new AppID.

### Event Parameters

When an event triggers a password UI change, you can control:

| Parameter      | Type    | Description                                       |
| -------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `isActive`     | boolean | `true` = show password UI, `false` = hide password UI |
| `isSync`       | boolean | `true` = all players see change, `false` = local only |
| `delay`        | number  | Seconds to wait before applying the change       |

### Emitted Events

The component automatically emits these events when passwords are validated:

| Event                    | Description                                       | Payload                                    |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `password-valid-<appID>`| Emitted when correct password is entered         | `{ userId, timestamp }`                   |
| `password-invalid-<appID>`| Emitted when incorrect password is entered      | `{ userId, timestamp }`                   |

## Common Use Cases

### 1. **Secret Door Access**
- Object: A hidden door or portal
- Event: Player touches a trigger
- Action: Password UI appears, player enters code, door unlocks on success

### 2. **Treasure Chest Protection**
- Object: A valuable item container
- Event: Player interacts with chest
- Action: Password UI shows, correct password reveals treasure

### 3. **Admin Panel Access**
- Object: A control panel or admin interface
- Event: Player clicks on panel
- Action: Password UI appears, admin features unlock on success

### 4. **Timed Password Reveals**
- Object: A hidden message or item
- Event: Timer reaches zero
- Action: Password UI appears after delay, player enters code to reveal content

### 5. **Multiplayer Synchronization**
- Object: A shared puzzle element
- Event: Any player triggers the puzzle
- Action: Password UI appears for all players, synchronized validation

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. **Add the Component**
- Drag the Insert Password component into your scene
- Select the 3D object you want to associate with the password system

### 2. **Configure Basic Settings**
- Set the `Node Name` to match your 3D object's name
- Choose if the object should `Start Visible`
- Decide if it should `Add Collision` (be solid)

### 3. **Set Up Password System**
- Enter your `Master Password` (the code players need to know)
- Set a `UI Title` for the password interface
- Choose what happens `When password success`

### 4. **Configure Events**
- In `Event Listeners`, add the events that should trigger the password UI
- Use the JSON format shown above
- Replace event names with actual events from other components

### 5. **Set Up Behavior**
- Enable `Sync Changes` if all players should see password UI changes
- Set `Use Delay` and `Delay (sec)` for timed reveals
- Enable `Designer Mode` for testing during development

### 6. **Test Your Setup**
- Enable `Debug Logs` to see what's happening
- Trigger your events and watch the password UI appear
- Test password validation with correct and incorrect codes
- Check that all players see the same interface

## Tips for Designers

### **Choosing Good Passwords**
- Use memorable but secure passwords
- Consider the theme of your world (e.g., "Dragon2024" for fantasy)
- Avoid overly complex codes that players might forget
- Test passwords with friends to ensure they're reasonable

### **Planning Your Password System**
- Think about when players should see the password UI
- Consider timing and delays for dramatic reveals
- Plan for both single-player and multiplayer scenarios
- Design clear visual cues for password-protected areas

### **Testing Your Setup**
- Always test with multiple players
- Use debug logs to troubleshoot issues
- Test edge cases (what happens if players disconnect?)
- Verify password validation works correctly

### **Performance Considerations**
- Don't show password UI too frequently
- Remember that the UI appears as a floating interface
- Consider the impact on mobile devices
- Test with different screen sizes

## Troubleshooting

### **Password UI Doesn't Appear**
- Check that your events are being sent correctly
- Verify that the `Event Listeners` format is correct
- Enable `Debug Logs` to see what's happening
- Test with `Designer Mode` enabled

### **Password Validation Not Working**
- Ensure `Master Password` is set correctly
- Check that the password field isn't empty
- Verify the password matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- Use debug logs to see validation attempts

### **Changes Not Syncing**
- Make sure `Sync Changes` is enabled
- Check that the event includes `"isSync": true`
- Verify all players are connected
- Test with simple events first

### **Delays Not Working**
- Ensure `Use Delay` is enabled
- Check that `Delay (sec)` is greater than 0
- Verify the delay value in your event parameters
- Remember: delays only postpone the instant change

### **UI Not Closing After Success**
- Check the `When password success` setting
- Verify that the success event is being emitted
- Use debug logs to see what's happening
- Test with different success options

## Best Practices

- **Start Simple**: Test with basic password validation before adding complexity
- **Use Clear Passwords**: Make your master password memorable but secure
- **Plan for Multiplayer**: Consider how password UI affects all players
- **Add Delays**: Use delays for smoother, more professional experiences
- **Test Thoroughly**: Always test with multiple players and scenarios
- **Use Debug Logs**: Enable debug mode during development
- **Document Your Setup**: Keep notes on your password and event configurations
- **Design Clear Triggers**: Make it obvious when players should see the password UI
- **Consider Accessibility**: Ensure password UI is visible and usable for all players

## Security Considerations

- **Player Experience**: Balance security with usability
- **Testing**: Always test password validation thoroughly
- **Documentation**: Keep passwords documented for testing purposes
- **Updates**: Consider changing passwords if they become compromised
