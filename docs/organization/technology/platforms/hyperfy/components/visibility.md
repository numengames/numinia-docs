# Visibility Component

The Visibility component allows you to control when 3D objects appear, disappear, or become solid in your scene. Think of it as a smart switch that can show/hide objects and make them solid or pass-through based on events happening in your world. It works across all connected players, so everyone sees the same changes at the same time.

**Important**: This component only handles instant visibility and collision state changes - it does not create visual transitions (like fade effects, scaling, or animations). For smooth visual transitions, you'll need to combine this with animation components or custom effects.

## What Does It Do?

The Visibility component is like having a remote control for your 3D objects. You can:
- **Show or hide objects** when something happens (like a player touches a button)
- **Make objects solid or pass-through** (collision on/off)
- **Add delays** so changes happen after a wait time (but still instant when they occur)
- **Sync changes** so all players see the same thing
- **Chain actions** by triggering other components when visibility changes

**Important**: This component only handles the showing/hiding and solid/pass-through states. You need other components (like buttons, triggers, or timers) to actually make things happen. The visibility changes are instant - for smooth visual transitions, you'll need animation components.

| `Event Listeners`           | textarea| `[]`    | List of events that trigger visibility changes    |

## How Events Work

The Visibility component listens for "signals" (events) from other components. When it receives a signal, it changes the object's visibility or collision state. The component uses its unique App ID (generated by Hyperfy) to identify itself in the event system.

### Event Format

In the `Event Listeners` field, you can specify events like this:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "a1b2c3d4e",
    "actions": [
      {
        "type": "set-visibility",
        "params": {
          "isVisible": true,
          "hasCollision": false,
          "delay": 1.5
        }
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

**Note**: When referencing this component in events from other components, use the App ID that Hyperfy generated for this component. Also, when duplicating components, be sure you make the app unique, so it has a new AppID

### Event Parameters

When an event triggers a visibility change, you can control:

| Parameter      | Type    | Description                                       |
| -------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `isVisible`    | boolean | `true` = show object, `false` = hide object      |
| `hasCollision` | boolean | `true` = solid object, `false` = pass-through    |
| `isSync`       | boolean | `true` = all players see change, `false` = local only |
| `delay`        | number  | Seconds to wait before applying the change       |

## Common Use Cases

### 1. **Hidden Doors**
- Object: A secret door
- Event: Player solves a puzzle
- Action: Door instantly becomes visible and solid

### 2. **Disappearing Platforms**
- Object: A platform that vanishes
- Event: Player steps on a trigger
- Action: Platform instantly becomes invisible and pass-through

### 3. **Synchronized Effects**
- Object: A treasure chest
- Event: Any player opens it
- Action: Chest instantly disappears for all players at the same time

### 4. **Timed Reveals**
- Object: A hidden message
- Event: Timer reaches zero
- Action: Message instantly appears after a 2-second delay

### 5. **Collision Management**
- Object: A barrier
- Event: Player collects a key
- Action: Barrier instantly becomes pass-through (collision off)

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. **Add the Component**
- Drag the Visibility component into your scene
- Select the 3D object you want to control

### 2. **Configure Basic Settings**
- Set the `Node Name` to match your 3D object's name
- Choose if the object should `Start Visible`
- Decide if it should `Add Collision` (be solid)

### 3. **Set Up Events**
- In `Event Listeners`, add the events that should trigger changes
- Use the JSON format shown above
- Replace event names with actual events from other components

### 4. **Configure Behavior**
- Enable `Sync Changes` if all players should see changes
- Set `Use Delay` and `Delay (sec)` for smooth transitions
- Enable `Emit When Shown/Hidden` to trigger other components

### 5. **Test Your Setup**
- Enable `Debug Logs` to see what's happening
- Trigger your events and watch the object change
- Check that all players see the same changes

## Tips for Designers

### **Naming Your Objects**
- Use clear, descriptive names for your 3D objects
- Avoid spaces and special characters in object names
- Example: `secret_door_01`, `treasure_chest`, `hidden_platform`

### **Planning Your Events**
- Think about what should trigger visibility changes
- Consider timing and delays for smooth experiences
- Plan for both single-player and multiplayer scenarios

### **Testing Your Setup**
- Always test with multiple players
- Use debug logs to troubleshoot issues
- Test edge cases (what happens if players disconnect?)

### **Performance Considerations**
- Don't change visibility too frequently
- Remember that changes are instant - no visual transitions
- Consider the impact on mobile devices

## Troubleshooting

### **Object Doesn't Change**
- Check that the `Node Name` matches exactly
- Verify that your events are being sent
- Enable `Debug Logs` to see what's happening

### **Changes Not Syncing**
- Make sure `Sync Changes` is enabled
- Check that the event includes `"isSync": true`
- Verify all players are connected

### **Delays Not Working**
- Ensure `Use Delay` is enabled
- Check that `Delay (sec)` is greater than 0
- Verify the delay value in your event parameters
- Remember: delays only postpone the instant change, they don't create smooth transitions

### **Want Smooth Transitions?**
- This component only does instant show/hide
- For fade effects, scale animations, or smooth transitions, you'll need animation components

### **Collision Issues**
- Check if `Add Collision` is enabled
- Verify `hasCollision` parameter in events
- Test with simple objects first


## Best Practices

- **Start Simple**: Test with basic show/hide before adding complexity
- **Use Descriptive Names**: Make your object and event names clear
- **Plan for Multiplayer**: Consider how changes affect all players
- **Add Delays**: Use delays for smoother, more professional experiences
- **Test Thoroughly**: Always test with multiple players and scenarios
- **Use Debug Logs**: Enable debug mode during development
- **Document Your Setup**: Keep notes on your event configurations
