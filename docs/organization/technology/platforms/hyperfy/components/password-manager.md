# Password Manager Component

The Password Manager component provides secure password input UI, validation, and integration with keyboard components for password-protected interactions in your Hyperfy world. Think of it as a comprehensive password system that can handle secure input, validation, and seamless integration with virtual keyboards.

**Important**: This component creates a password input interface that appears when triggered and validates user input against a master password. It works seamlessly with keyboard components to provide secure password input and can emit events on success/failure.

## What Does It Do?

The Password Manager component is like having a secure password system for your 3D world. You can:
- **Create password input UI** that appears when triggered
- **Validate passwords** against a master password you set
- **Integrate with virtual keyboards** for secure input
- **Emit success/failure events** for other components to handle
- **Sync password UI state** across all players in multiplayer environments
- **Control password input visibility** through events
- **Handle secure authentication** for protected content

**Important**: This component creates a floating password input interface that appears when activated. Players input passwords using virtual keyboards, and the component validates them against your master password. It's designed to work seamlessly with keyboard components for secure input.

| `show-password-input` | Show the password input UI | None |
| `hide-password-input` | Hide the password input UI | None |
| `validate-password` | Validate a password against the master password | `password` (string) |

### Emitted Events

The component automatically emits these events when passwords are validated:

| Event                    | Description                                       | Payload                                    |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `password-success-<appID>`| Emitted when password validation succeeds         | `{ userId, timestamp }`                   |
| `password-error-<appID>`| Emitted when password validation fails            | `{ userId, timestamp }`                   |

### Keyboard Integration Events

The component listens for these events from keyboard components:

## Tips for Designers

### **Choosing Good Passwords**
- Use memorable but secure passwords
- Consider the theme of your world (e.g., "Dragon2024" for fantasy)
- Avoid overly complex codes that players might forget
- Test passwords with friends to ensure they're reasonable

### **Planning Your Password System**
- Think about when players should see the password UI
- Consider timing and delays for dramatic reveals
- Plan for both single-player and multiplayer scenarios
- Design clear visual cues for password-protected areas

### **Testing Your Setup**
- Always test with multiple players
- Use debug logs to troubleshoot issues
- Test edge cases (what happens if players disconnect?)
- Verify password validation works correctly

### **Performance Considerations**
- Password validation is instant - minimal performance impact
- Consider the impact on player experience
- Test with different screen sizes and devices

## Troubleshooting

- **Access Control**: Ensure only authorized players can access protected content

## Integration Examples

### **Keyboard Integration**
```javascript
// Listen for keyboard events
app.on('keypad-character-keyboard123', ({ character }) => {
  // Add character to password input
  passwordInput += character;
});

app.on('keypad-backspace-keyboard123', () => {
  // Remove last character
  passwordInput = passwordInput.slice(0, -1);
});

app.on('keypad-enter-keyboard123', () => {
  // Validate password
  validatePassword(passwordInput);
});
```

### **Password Validation Events**
```javascript
// Listen for password validation results
app.on('password-success-password123', ({ userId, timestamp }) => {
  // Password was correct - grant access
  grantAccess(userId);
});

app.on('password-error-password123', ({ userId, timestamp }) => {
  // Password was incorrect - deny access
  denyAccess(userId);
});
```

### **Visibility Control**
```javascript
// Show password input
world.emit('visibility-password123', { isVisible: true });

// Hide password input
world.emit('visibility-password123', { isVisible: false });
```
