# 3D Platforms

This section documents the various 3D platforms and engines we use to create immersive experiences. We work with multiple technologies to deliver optimal solutions based on project requirements.

## Contents

- **[Overview](platforms-details)**: General overview of our approach to 3D platforms and spatial computing.

- **Comparison**:
  - **[Supported Platforms](comparison/supported-platforms)**: Detailed comparison of the 3D platforms we currently support.

- **Hyperfy**:
  - **[Hyperfy Integration](hyperfy/hyperfy-integration)**: Implementation details of our Hyperfy integration.

## Key Technologies

Our 3D platform strategy leverages several key technologies:

- **WebGL-based Engines**: For cross-platform browser compatibility
- **3D Asset Management**: Optimized 3D model pipelines
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket and WebRTC implementations
- **Spatial Computing**: 3D interaction systems
- **Component Systems**: Reusable functionality across experiences

## Platform Selection Criteria

When evaluating platforms for a specific project, we consider:

1. Performance requirements
2. Deployment constraints
3. Feature needs
4. Customization requirements
5. Integration with existing systems
6. Long-term maintainability
