# Supported Platforms

We currently work with multiple 3D platforms for creating immersive spaces, each with different deployment models and capabilities.

## Platform Comparison

| Feature                    | Hyperfy          | Oncyber          | Substrata        |
|---------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Status**                | Production Ready | Production Ready | In Development   |
| **Deployment Model**      | Self-hosted      | Platform-hosted  | Self-hosted      |
| **Component Development** | Yes              | No              | In Progress      |
| **Infrastructure**        | Custom           | Platform-managed | Custom           |
