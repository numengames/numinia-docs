# Platform Comparison

This section provides detailed comparisons of the various 3D platforms we support. These comparisons help stakeholders understand the strengths, limitations, and use cases for each platform, facilitating informed decision-making when selecting a technology for a specific project.

## Contents

- **[Supported Platforms](supported-platforms)**: Comprehensive comparison of our currently supported 3D platforms, including deployment models, capabilities, and implementation status.

## Comparison Criteria

Our platform evaluations cover these key areas:

- **Deployment Model**: Self-hosted vs. platform-hosted
- **Development Flexibility**: Custom component development capabilities
- **Performance**: Rendering efficiency and scalability
- **Feature Set**: Available built-in functionality
- **Integration Options**: Connectivity with existing systems
- **Customization**: Ability to modify platform behavior
- **Infrastructure**: Deployment and management requirements

## Selection Framework

When evaluating platforms for specific projects, we consider:

1. The specific requirements of the project
2. The target audience and their technical constraints
3. Development timeline and resource availability
4. Long-term maintenance considerations
5. Budget constraints
6. Scalability needs

## Future Platforms

We continuously evaluate emerging 3D platforms and technologies. Future comparisons will include:

- WebXR-specific frameworks
- Native AR/VR platforms
- Cloud-rendered solutions
