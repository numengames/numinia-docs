# Platforms Overview

Our technology stack is designed to support multiple 3D platforms, each chosen for its specific capabilities and alignment with our goals of creating immersive, educational experiences. We focus on open-source solutions that enable us to build, customize, and extend functionality according to our needs.

## Platform Selection Criteria

Our platform selection follows specific criteria to ensure alignment with our objectives:

1. **Open Source Foundation**: We prioritize platforms that embrace open-source principles, allowing us to contribute to and benefit from community development.

2. **Performance**: Each platform must support smooth rendering of complex 3D environments with multiple concurrent users.

3. **Extensibility**: The ability to create custom components and extend functionality is essential for our educational and training implementations.

4. **Community Support**: Active development communities help ensure platform longevity and continuous improvement.

## Implementation Approach

Our vision aligns with the principles of the Open Metaverse - a future where digital spaces are interconnected, open-source, and accessible to all. We believe in breaking down the barriers between different platforms and creating experiences that can seamlessly transition across various virtual environments.

Our implementation strategy focuses on developing components that can work across different platforms while maintaining their unique characteristics and capabilities. We aim to create solutions that are both powerful and accessible, regardless of the chosen implementation method.

To support this vision, we offer two distinct approaches for implementing our solutions:

### In-Platform Integration

The first approach allows developers and designers to work directly within their chosen platform. We provide a component interface that connects seamlessly with our component repository, enabling:

- Direct access to our component library from within the platform
- Real-time component updates and versioning
- Integrated configuration and customization tools
- Automatic compatibility management

### Standalone Implementation

The second approach caters to developers who prefer more control over their implementation. By accessing our codebase directly, developers can:

- Download platform-specific implementations
- Customize and extend components locally
- Integrate components into existing workflows
- Maintain their own deployment pipeline

This flexible approach allows teams to choose the implementation method that best suits their needs while maintaining access to our growing ecosystem of components and tools.

### Platform-Specific Implementation

Each supported platform has its own dedicated section in our documentation, covering implementation details, specific features, and optimization strategies. See our [Supported Platforms][platforms] guide for detailed information about each platform.

### Common Resources

Across all platforms, we maintain:

- [Component Development][components]: Universal building blocks and patterns
- [Integration Guide][integration]: Infrastructure and service connections
- [Best Practices][practices]: Cross-platform optimization strategies
- [Examples][examples]: Reference implementations for each platform

## Future Development

Our platform strategy remains flexible, allowing us to adapt to emerging technologies and community needs. We continuously evaluate new platforms and technologies that could enhance our capability to deliver engaging, educational experiences.
