# Platforms Overview

We work with different 3D platforms to create immersive spaces, with varying levels of integration depending on each platform's characteristics and availability. Our approach focuses on practical implementation and active contribution to open-source platforms.

## Current Platforms

### Hyperfy

Hyperfy is our primary development platform, where we maintain both a deployment infrastructure and active development contributions:

#### Infrastructure Implementation
- Maintaining a forked version of the platform
- Building and managing our own Docker images
- Deploying and managing Hyperfy spaces in our Kubernetes cluster

#### Platform Contributions
- Core functionality components that creates basic functionality:
- Contributing improvements back to the main Hyperfy repository
- Implementing optimizations for large-scale deployments

For detailed deployment information, refer to our [Infrastructure documentation](/docs/organization/technology/infrastructure).

### Oncyber

We currently use Oncyber through their hosted platform:
- Creating and managing spaces on Oncyber's infrastructure
- Working within their platform's existing capabilities
- Utilizing their standard deployment tools

## Future Considerations

We continue monitoring platform developments that could enhance our capabilities:

### Substrata
Currently in development. We will evaluate its potential for specialized use cases once it becomes available.

For specific platform capabilities and technical details, see our [Supported Platforms](./comparison/supported-platforms) documentation.
