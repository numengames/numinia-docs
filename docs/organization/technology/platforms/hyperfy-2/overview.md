# Hyperfy 2 Development Areas

This section covers our work and contributions within the Hyperfy 2 ecosystem, organized into key development areas:

## Infrastructure

Our cloud architecture and deployment solutions focus on scalability and reliability, designed to be cloud-provider agnostic. Learn more in the [infrastructure section](/docs/organization/technology/hyperfy-2/infrastructure/overview).

Key aspects include:
- Cloud infrastructure management
- Provider-agnostic Terraform modules for flexible deployments
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) best practices
- Scalable deployment strategies across environments

While our current implementation uses AWS services, the architecture is designed to be adaptable to other cloud providers through our Terraform-based approach.

## Components

Our component development extends Hyperfy 2 capabilities. Explore our [components documentation](/docs/organization/technology/hyperfy-2/components/overview) for:
- Custom component development
- Integration patterns and best practices

## Current Focus Areas

Our development efforts are concentrated on:
1. **Cloud Infrastructure**: Scalable and reliable deployment solutions
2. **Component Library**: Reusable elements for space creation
3. **Integration Patterns**: Connecting Hyperfy with external services
4. **Performance Optimization**: Ensuring smooth experiences at scale
