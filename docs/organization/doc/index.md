# Reference Components Library

This folder collects **external visual references** of gameplay components, interactions, and UI patterns from existing games and applications. These are **not internal components**. They are curated **inspirational examples** intended to inform the design and development of our own future systems.

## Purpose

- To document and organize references from other environments (games, platforms, tools, etc.)
- To highlight relevant visual or mechanical behaviors
- To use them as design foundations or benchmarks for future components
- To centralize material that can be discussed in workshops, design reviews, or implementation planning

## Content Guidelines

Each reference entry includes:
- A video or GIF clip (typically 10‚Äì60 seconds)
- Game or source information
- Commentary on what‚Äôs interesting or useful
- Key design/technical takeaways
- Categorization for navigation

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: This folder is purely educational and internal. We do not own the rights to any of the referenced material.
