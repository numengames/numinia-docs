## 🎯 Type: External Reference

This is **not a Numen component** — it’s something we’re using as a learning tool and source of inspiration.

Use cases:
- Design workshops and team discussions  
- System planning and breakdown  
- Educational onboarding for new teammates  

Recommended format:
- Video length: 10–60 seconds  
- Clear file naming (e.g. `dash-hollowknight.gif`)  
- Optional subtitle or label: `"REFERENCE: Dash mechanic"`

## 🔄 How This Fits into Our Workflow

This reference is part of a larger cycle:

- First, we observe and document external ideas  
- Later, we might prototype something similar internally  
- That can lead to tutorials, reusable logic, or public showcases

Each entry here helps us connect **what we like** with **what we might build**.
