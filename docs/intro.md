# Overview

A comprehensive suite of tools and technologies for creating immersive digital spaces. Our ecosystem leverages emerging technologies to build interactive environments focused on learning, collaboration, and experimentation. With more than 50 active spaces deployed and maintained, we develop robust frameworks and methodologies for creating engaging digital experiences.

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies

- **Three.js-based Engines**: We work with various Three.js-based engines to create high-performance 3D environments
- **Supported Platforms**:
  - **Hyperfy 2**: A powerful platform for creating immersive spaces, where we actively contribute with cloud architecture and specific components
  - **Oncyber**: An alternative platform for creating inmersive spaces
  - **Substrata**: A high-performance engine for specific applications close to the hardware

### Development Infrastructure

The codebase includes integrations and components for:

- **Core APIs**: Backend services for platform interactions, digital agents, and real-time communication
- **Integration Layer**: Comprehensive connectors for Discord, social platforms, and third-party services
- **Smart Contracts**: Web3 integration for digital asset management and ownership
- **Digital Agents**: AI-powered solutions for interactive experiences and automation
- **3D Components**: Library of reusable elements for the platforms we support

## Project Structure

The documentation is organized into key sections:

### [Hyperfy 2](/docs/organization/technology/hyperfy-2/overview)
Our main focus for spatial development, including:
- [Infrastructure](/docs/organization/technology/hyperfy-2/infrastructure/overview): Cloud architecture, deployment guides, and AWS setup
- [Components](/docs/organization/technology/hyperfy-2/components/overview): Core and custom component development
- Best practices and implementation patterns

<!-- ### [ai16z](/docs/ai16z/overview)
Integration of AI capabilities:
